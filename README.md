# Fun Interactive Random Circle Generator

This is just a fun circle generator that creates a bunch of circles, and randomly chooses a color scheme. Hovering over circles with your mouse will enlarge nearby circles

!DISCLOSURE - Most of this code was created by following a YouTube tutorial by Chris Courses. I was following his HTML5 Canvas Tutorial series, and made a few minor changes.

## Features

* Random color generation picks from a short list of arrays of 5 colors each that create different color schemes.
* Hovering over circles with your mouse will enlarge nearby circles.

## Contributing

* If you would like to contribute, it would be cool to see randomly generated shapes, or complex shapes.
